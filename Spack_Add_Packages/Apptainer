%help
    This build file adds all the components needed to add 
    new packages to Spack. Obviously we need to add our 
    Spack fork. Then, of course, we can also use that
    instance of Spack to install most tools we need.
    Git is the obvious exception as we need that to clone
    Spack.

# The following is not needed if we mount the home directory
# because then we can ssh-add our credentials with the
# absolute filename of our private key on the host machine.

    # Here life gets interesting. As we cannot push code to github from within
    # a running Apptainer the Spack sources we want to change need to live in
    # folder on the host. During building an Apptainer the external mounted
    # filesystems are not accessible. Therefore I cannot use the host spack 
    # version to set Spack related stuff up in the container. Hence
    # I need to install Spack in the container for building the container.
    # But I need to switch to the host Spack installation when running the 
    # container.
